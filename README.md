# Code Quiz

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz from scratch. Once users begin the quiz, they are presented with a series of multiple choice questions. A timer will also begin to count down in the top right corner. Once all questions have been answered or the time runs out, a score is calculated by considering correct answers and speed of completion. Users are able to save their scores to local storage.
