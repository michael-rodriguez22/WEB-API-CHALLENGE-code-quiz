# Code Quiz

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz from scratch. I did not utilize any frameworks or libraries, and instead used this as an opportunity to refresh my skills with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I utilized two Javascript files linked in separate script tags to provide basic modularization of code that is normally achieved with tools like Node. I also used a few utility classes, such as rows and hoverable buttons, to replicate repeatable functionality found in CSS frameworks.

This page is responsive, meaning you can enjoy this user interface on any device. This page also has some advanced characteristics, such as maintaining the state of multiple factors at all times, and dynamically rendering interactive content based on that state.

The user is presented with the rules of the quiz upon page load. Beginning the quiz starts a timer and presents a series of multiple choice questions. Users are able to save their scores to local storage upon completion of the quiz.

Deployed site is viewable <a href="https://mikeyrod22.github.io/WEB-API-CHALLENGE-code-quiz/">here</a>. Enjoy!
